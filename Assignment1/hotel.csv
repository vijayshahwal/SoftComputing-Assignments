Review1,"You can't call it a Hotel or a Hostel, they are charging for the basic stuff like towel and all as they call themselves a Hostel, but are not even providing any basic Amenities which any hostel would, no common kitchen if you want to make something, if you want a cup of hot water you have to pay 3 Euro! I believe any Hostel or Hotel will not charge you for a cup of hot water.
