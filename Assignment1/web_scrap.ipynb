      "Review 2 : This hotel is in the kuah area. so it is a bit far from major activities and beaches like Cenang and Tanjung Rhu. Apart from that it is a beautiful hotel with great view. Also, it has great food. The breakfast spread would make any vegetarian or non-vegetarian happy. They also had a vegetarian thali that was close to a north indian thali you would get in India.

      "Review 1 : A beautiful resort with worst service experience. First of all they upgraded my room having nothing in it except bath gel and shampoo. Dissapoonting 300ml water bottle which is ridiculous. Then no slippers, single person linen on king size bed. Bathtub without stopper and when asked delay it of no use. For every request we need to fight to get it and in first place they say NO and then fight to get ot. Absolutely a great place in worst service hand.\n",
      "Review 2 : Regretted booking it. Pictures are too good but reality is different. The hotel is an old property ,not well maintained. Does not fit for five star category. Very basic outdated rooms. Balconies of rooms are very close to each other, lacks comfort, beauty and privacy. Small alleys and corridors. Service is slow and for everything there are charges. Example, i asked for two digital keys as we were two people, they asked extra charges for that too. Every sensible 4-5 star hotel gives 2 keys to 2 occupants.\n",

However I had notice the drastic drop in service standard as compared to when the hotel first started operation about 3 years ago. The staff were very attentive and friendly who would greet you whenever you walk in and out of the hotel back then. But not now. We had even to push the luggage trolley to load our stuff. However this was not the greatest issue.\n",

Breakfast is average with hardly any noticeable change in the menu for the entire stay. Liked their choice of pillow. All rooms are no smoking with no balcony. 7/11 is hardly 100m away in case you need to snack or buy spirits.\n",
