In the Probability
and Satistics course (PBS-432), you perhaphs have implemented the concept of
Box-Muller transformation. If not, please learn about it now, because it is
very useful and has wide range of applications. In the machine learning
Gaussian distribution/the Normal Distribution is the workhorse and being able
to draw samples from this distribution lies at the heart of many machine
learning algorithms. Box-Muller transform enables us to transform any 
i.i.d (independently identical distribution), say  uniform distribution
U(0,1) to i.i.d normal distribution N(0,1).


You need to implement
the Box-Muller Algorithm and show that the generated samples are indeed
normally distributed by generating a plot in Python. May use and study the
following hints.
